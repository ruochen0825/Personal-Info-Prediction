# Personal-Info-Prediction
This project aims to reproduce and verify the data analysis result in Michal Kosinski, David Stillwell, and Thore Graepel’s paper of “Private traits and attributes are predictable from digital records of human behavior”[1]. The original paper revealed that the personal information can be predicted with Facebook Likes. The conclusion was supported by detailed data analysis results. The reproducing work follows all the methods that were used in theoriginal paper. Some necessary adjustments are made due to limited computing power and data accessibility. The results of reproducing work are presented and compared with original work.
